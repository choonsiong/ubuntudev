## To run the container using `docker container run`

> Note:

> `~/Root/Playground` is just a directory I use to keep all my programming source code, you can replace it with other directory, but it will still mounted under /root/playground inside the container ðŸ˜…, you can remove the `-v ...` below if you do not want to bind mount the directory.

Run the command `docker container run -it --name ubuntudev -v ~/Root/Playground:/root/playground choonsiong/ubuntudev`

## To start a stop container

First start the container then user the `exec` command to get into the shell.

```
 22:35:43 364  
 22:35:43 364  docker container ls -a
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE                  COMMAND       CREATED         STATUS                     PORTS     NAMES

## To run the container using `docker compose`

First clone the git repository, then start the container with `docker-compose run ubuntu bash`

The volume is mounted automatically when using `docker-compose` (you will need to create the local mount point).

This is useful if you do not want to keep the container after using it (`docker compose down` will clean up the created container etc).

```
 15:02:30 364  docker-compose run ubuntu bash
Creating network "ubuntudev_my_net" with driver "bridge"
Creating ubuntudev_ubuntu_run ... done
root@d4cd038dc1ff:~# 
root@d4cd038dc1ff:~# exit
exit
 15:02:38 364  
 15:02:38 364  docker compose down
The new 'docker compose' command is currently experimental. To provide feedback or request new features please open issues at https://github.com/docker/compose-cli
